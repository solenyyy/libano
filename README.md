# Restaurante El Líbano 🍽
```
I made this project from scratch. It is a website for a Lebanese restaurant, very simple but with a lot of design work. The idea is that it would be a landing page type, only for information purposes for customers and that they would have access to an online letter and contact information. I did it using vue cli. It has two libraries: one called AOS for animations and another called vue-scroll-to since as it is a component-based app, it was the most optimal way to create a scroll to an anchor.
